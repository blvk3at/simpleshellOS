# Simple Shell Program

The Simple Shell Program is a basic command-line interface that allows users to execute commands and perform basic shell operations. It provides an interactive mode for immediate command execution and a batch mode for executing commands from a file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- The Simple Shell Program is written in C and requires a C compiler to build and run the code.
- Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).

### Building the Program
1. Clone or download the Simple Shell Program repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and compile the source code using the following command:

//gcc -o ProjectDemoOS.c//

4. After successful compilation, an executable file named `simple_shell` will be generated in the project directory.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the shell program by executing the following command:

./a.out

4. The shell prompt will be displayed, indicating that the shell is ready to accept commands.
5. Enter commands and press Enter to execute them. Output will be displayed on the terminal.

6. The shell will read the commands from the file and execute them sequentially. Output will be displayed on the terminal.

### Exiting the Shell
- To exit the shell in interactive mode, use the "exit" command or send an EOF (End-of-File) signal (e.g., press Ctrl + D).
- In batch mode, the shell will automatically exit after executing all the commands in the file.

## Future Enhancements
- The Simple Shell Program can be further enhanced by adding more advanced functionalities, such as:
- Input/output redirection to redirect command input or output to files.
- Environment variable handling to allow users to set and use environment variables.
- Command history to provide a record of previously executed commands and allow for command recall.
- More built-in commands or custom command aliases to extend the shell's functionality.
- User interface enhancements, such as colored output or tab completion, can be implemented to improve usability.
